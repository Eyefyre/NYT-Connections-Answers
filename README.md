This repo contains a JSON file containing the answers to the NYT Connections game and is updated daily.

Level 0 = Yellow\
Level 1 = Green\
Level 2 = Blue\
Level 3 = Purple


As of 20th September 2025, V1 of the NYT Connections API was removed, forcing a move to V2.

V2 doesn't include the level/colour data in the API call, so I have opted to replace this with -1 in the data.

Currently receiving "Extra Data" JSON error in the Github action logs which is not reproducible on my machine, will continue investigating
